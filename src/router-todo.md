# Router Implementation Todo and Roadmap

## Current Issues

### 1. Authentication Implementation

- Using Context instead of Zustand store
- Hardcoded auth check in dashboard route
- No integration with global auth store state
- Missing proper auth guard utility

### 2. Import Structure

- Direct imports from '@tanstack/react-router' instead of lib/vendors
- Missing centralized vendor imports
- Inconsistent import patterns

### 3. Route Type Safety

- Missing Zod schema validations
- No type definitions for route params
- Incomplete loader data types
- Missing search params validation

### 4. Route Organization

- Flat route structure
- Missing feature-based route modules
- No dedicated route type definitions
- Missing route metadata

### 5. Performance

- Basic code splitting
- No route prefetching strategy
- Missing route transition optimizations

## Features to Add

### 1. Authentication

- Zustand store integration for auth checks
- Role-based access control
- Auth guard utilities
- Protected route wrapper

### 2. Type Safety

- Route params validation with Zod
- Search params type definitions
- Loader and action type safety
- Route metadata types

### 3. Navigation

- Scroll management
- Route transitions
- Loading states
- Error boundaries
- Deep linking support

### 4. Performance

- Route-based code splitting
- Prefetching strategy
- Route caching
- Optimistic updates

### 5. Developer Experience

- Route debugging utilities
- Type-safe route builders
- Route testing utilities

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Structure

1. [x] Create vendor index file for all TanStack Router exports
2. [x] Setup route type definitions and validations
3. [x] Implement auth guard using Zustand store
4. [x] Restructure route organization

### Phase 2: Type Safety

1. [x] Add Zod schemas for route params
2. [x] Implement type-safe search params
3. [x] Create loader and action type utilities
4. [x] Add route metadata types

### Phase 3: Navigation Features

1. [x] Implement scroll restoration
2. [x] Add route transitions
3. [x] Create loading state management
4. [x] Setup error boundaries

### Phase 4: Performance

1. [x] Implement route-based code splitting
2. [x] Add prefetching strategies
3. [x] Setup route caching
4. [x] Implement optimistic updates

### Phase 5: Developer Experience

1. [x] Create debugging utilities
2. [x] Add route testing setup
3. [x] Create route builder utilities
4. [ ] Add documentation

### Phase 6: Polish

1. Performance optimization
2. Bug fixes
3. Testing
4. Documentation updates

## Implementation Notes

- All third-party imports must come from lib/vendors/index.tsx
- Follow modular approach for all implementations
- Maintain type safety throughout
- Keep performance in mind for all features
- Document all utilities and features
- Always use absolute imports
- All Loaders, utils, and other dependencies should be imported from their respective directories/files

## Project Analysis and Refactoring

### 1. Project Structure Analysis

- [ ] Scan and analyze all project files and folders
- [ ] Document current project architecture and patterns
- [ ] Identify potential improvements in file organization
- [ ] Review existing component and utility relationships
- [ ] Map data flow and state management patterns

### 2. Router Implementation Review

- [ ] Evaluate current router implementation against best practices
- [ ] Identify areas for potential optimization
- [ ] Consider alternative implementation approaches if necessary
- [ ] Document pros and cons of current implementation
- [ ] Plan migration strategy if rewrite is needed

## Progress Tracking

- Each task will be marked with [x] when completed
- Regular reviews will be conducted to update progress
- New tasks will be added as they are identified
