# API Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made in creating the new enhanced API client (`api-new.ts`). The implementation combines the reliability of the original API client (`api-old.ts`) with modern features, improved TypeScript support, and a flexible interface supporting multiple usage patterns.

## Core Functionality Preserved

The new implementation preserves all essential functionality from `api-old.ts`:

- **Exact Key Generation Logic**: Maintained the same key generation mechanism to ensure proper token lookup.
- **Header and Parameter Handling**: All headers and parameters are set up identically to ensure full compatibility.
- **Direct HTTP Methods**: The simple `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, and `sql` methods work exactly as before.
- **Token Management**: Token lookup and application works the same way.

## Key Improvements and Additions

The new implementation adds significant improvements:

1. **Enhanced TypeScript Support**

   - Full TypeScript interface definitions
   - Generic type parameters for better type safety
   - Proper error typing

2. **Retry Logic**

   - Configurable exponential backoff for failed requests
   - Automatic retries with increasing delay

3. **Request Cancellation**

   - Support for cancelling in-flight requests
   - CancelToken generation and management

4. **Caching System**

   - Integrated with the cache module
   - Configurable cache durations
   - Cache bypassing when needed

5. **Resource-based API**

   - Encapsulates CRUD operations for resources
   - Reduces repetitive endpoint construction
   - Maintains consistency across resource operations

6. **Fluent Query Builder**
   - Chainable methods for building complex requests
   - Type-safe query building
   - Improved developer experience with method discovery

## Architecture

The new API is built on several key components:

1. **Core Request Handler**: `makeRequest()` function handles the actual HTTP request, error handling, and response processing.

2. **Request Configuration Builder**: `buildRequestConfig()` handles generating the proper headers, parameters, and base URL.

3. **Key Generation**: `uniqueKey()` and `buildRequestKey()` functions ensure consistent key generation for token lookup.

4. **QueryBuilder Class**: Provides the fluent interface for building requests with chainable methods.

5. **ResourceManager Class**: Wraps common CRUD operations for a specific resource.

6. **API Interface**: Provides multiple ways to interact with the API.

7. **Axios Instance**: Configured with interceptors for logging and retry logic.

## Migration Considerations

When migrating from `api-old.ts` to `api-new.ts`:

1. All existing code using the direct HTTP methods will continue to work without changes.
2. Consider adopting the resource-based or query builder patterns for new code.
3. Take advantage of caching for frequently accessed, relatively static data.
4. Use TypeScript generics for better type safety.
