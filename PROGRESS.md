# Progress Tracking

## API Implementation Enhancements - [Date]

### Completed

- Created a new enhanced API client (api-new.ts) that combines:
  - Core functionality from api-old.ts (proper token generation, headers, etc.)
  - Modern features (caching, retry logic, request cancellation)
  - Multiple interface patterns (direct HTTP, resource-based, query builder)
- Added comprehensive TypeScript support with proper typing
- Implemented proper error handling with consistent error format
- Created documentation:
  - API_DOCUMENTATION.md - Technical details of implementation
  - API_README.md - Usage examples for all patterns

### Benefits

- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
- Added flexible, chainable query building
- Improved developer experience with code completion
- Reduced code duplication for common CRUD operations
- Added built-in caching for performance optimization
- Enhanced error handling and request retry capabilities

### Next Steps

- Migrate existing code to use the new API client
- Create tests to validate all functionality
- Add more specialized methods for common operations
- Consider implementing hook-based interfaces for React components

## Admin Book Management Fix - [Current Date]

### Completed

- Fixed book deletion functionality in the admin panel
- Modified the handleDelete function to properly mark books as deleted (setting is_deleted flag to true) instead of removing them from the list
- Updated confirmation dialog text to clearly explain that books will be marked as deleted rather than permanently removed
- Changed button text from "Delete" to "Mark as Deleted" to better reflect the operation

### Benefits

- Books are now properly marked as deleted in the database via API
- Deleted books remain visible in the admin panel with a "Deleted" status badge
- Improved user experience with clearer messaging about what happens when a book is deleted
- Maintains data integrity by not permanently removing book records
